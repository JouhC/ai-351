       "[\"visceral fat more than subcutaneous fat has been associated with numerous age-related problems, such as insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and cardiac diastolic dysfunction. computed tomography (ct) is a widely adopted technique for assessing abdominal fat. measurements of subcutaneous and visceral fat areas are typically computed from ct images using manual or semimanual analyses operated by clinical specialists. even though these techniques usually provide reliable results, they are time-consuming and affected by intra-and inter-operator variability. therefore, a regional fat quantification approach is highly desirable to increase the analysis throughput and reproducibility, especially in large epidemiological studies (3)(4)(5)(6). earlier abdomen fat quantification approaches (7,8) required user intervention to define a region of interest and detected the fat voxels using density thresholding techniques in the domain of hounsfield units (hus). more recent techniques make use of joint intensity and texture information in a fuzzy affinity framework to identify the fat class (9), employ shape and appearance models for quantification of regional fat and muscle compartments (10), or use radial analysis to delineate the boundary between subcutaneous and visceral fat (11). despite the high level of sophistication and accuracy that has been achieved by the state-ofthe-art methods, the presence of food residues in the intestines that can greatly reduce precision and even introduce a bias in the measure has not been explicitly addressed in the literature. the pixels of the food particles have hus that greatly overlap with those of the visceral fat voxels and are usually identified as fat when simple intensity criteria are used. the quantification error induced by food residues can introduce a relevant bias in studies of aging because the permanence of food residues is likely to occur in larger quantities in older than in younger individuals. herein we present a method for automated quantification of abdominal fat in ct that concentrates on reducing false positives in the estimation of visceral fat resulting from food residues. the fat identification and separation stage uses intensity-based clustering and a gradient vector flow (gvf) active contour model. in several instances, the detected visceral fat includes regions of food residues. to exclude these areas from the quantification of visceral fat, we applied a machine learning scheme that employs texture, local shape features, and a support vector machine (svm) classifier to identify and remove the food residues within the intestines. the food residue removal stage is applied as a final step in our methodology. in the experiment section, we report performance evaluation of our method against semimanually segmented reference masks of fat regions and draw conclusions on the applicability of this approach in a large-scale study. our methodology can be divided into three main processes: identification of global fat voxels, separation of visceral from subcutaneous fat, and removal of food residues. the main steps of these processes are depicted in figure 1 and are described in the following section. in our experiments, we used 168 ct abdomen scans of participants of the baltimore longitudinal study of aging (blsa), an ongoing epidemiological study that focuses on aging and age-related traits. we selected participants over a wide range of body mass index and visceral and subcutaneous fat areas. we applied our scheme to single-slice ct images acquired at the umbilical level (i.e., at the l4-l5 vertebrae on the lumbar column using a siemens somatom sensation 10 ct scanner [siemens, malvern, pa]). all scans were performed with a 500 × 500 mm field of view, 512 × 512 image matrix, and 10-mm slice thickness. the considerable slice thickness was employed to achieve a more extensive superoinferior coverage at the umbilical level and reduce the variability typical of a thin slice. we first removed the bed and calibration phantom from the trunk by applying foreground/ background thresholding and selecting the largest connected component as the trunk. then, we applied fuzzy c-means clustering (12) to the pixel intensities of the trunk and divided the pixels into four groups corresponding to air, muscle, fat, and bone tissues. fuzzy c-means produces vectors of cluster membership values in the range [0,1] for all input samples. each sample was subsequently assigned to the cluster of maximum membership. we mapped the labeled samples back to the image plane and identified the fat group based on the average cluster intensity. our next task was to separate the subcutaneous from visceral region of fat using a gvf snakes-based approach (13). the main difficulty was that the contrast between the subcutaneous region and visceral cavity is much lower than the contrast between the subcutaneous region and air thus affecting the gvf computation. to overcome this limitation, we computed the gvf on the fat membership map produced by fuzzy c-means that enhances the contrast between fat and other tissues. after snake convergence, we labeled the interior fat pixels as visceral and the exterior fat pixels as subcutaneous. this fat segmentation technique is expected to produce acceptable measurements of subcutaneous and visceral fat. however, a frequent source of error in the quantification of visceral fat is the presence of food residues in the intestines during the scan. therefore, correction of this error is of critical importance. an example of manual food residue removal is displayed in figure 2. in our preliminary experiments, we observed that the food residues may take on variable shapes and sizes in the intestines and subsequently in the visceral cavity. therefore we expect shape and size to be of limited separation capability. in addition, the hus of food residues are greatly overlapping with the hus of the visceral fat as seen in figure 3, indicating that the use of original intensities only, would yield high classification error. therefore we decided to use texture-based and local shape features along with intensity features for separation of food residues from visceral fat. we used gabor filters to extract textured image features in multiple resolutions. the wavelet transform has been widely used for multiscale representation and analysis of signals in medical and biological applications. the main difference from traditional fourier techniques is that wavelets can localize the information in the time-frequency plane (14). more specifically, the wavelet transforms provide a time-frequency decomposition of a signal over a range of characteristic frequencies that separates individual signal components more effectively than conventional fourier analysis techniques. the gabor filters have the advantage of optimizing the joint two-dimensional uncertainty in time and frequency and can be considered as edge and line bar detectors that can be tuned for different orientations and scales (15,16). gabor functions form a complete but nonorthogonal basis. the twodimensional gabor function is the product of an elliptical gaussian and a complex sinusoid and is given by: (1) in this equation, σ x and σ y are the standard deviations of the elliptical gaussian along x and y orientations and w is the sinusoid frequency. the filter dictionary can be produced by dilations and rotations of the mother gabor wavelet (17). we used a filter bank of four scales and six orientations that is illustrated in figure 4. details on derivation of twodimensional gabor filters are given elsewhere (18). the laws' texture energy filters (18) were designed to measure the amount of variation within a sliding window over the image plane. the basic operators were one-dimensional arrays that can be transposed and multiplied among each other to generate two-dimensional kernels. we computed 24 features based on pair-wise combinations of the one-dimensional kernel bank of {l5,e5,s5,r5,w5} used for averaging, and edge, spot, ripple, and wave detection, respectively. we use the average l5l5 for contrast normalization and then we omit it from the texture representation producing a texture vector with 24 components for each pixel. we generated multiscale representations of the original ct images according to scale-space theory. starting from the original formulation of scale-space theory (19), witkin formalized the scale-space representation of a signal as its convolution with gaussian filters of increasing widths (20). koendering later generalized the idea and pointed out that the scalespace is produced by the solution of heat diffusion equation (21). several applications have been proposed since then, including multiscale segmentation (22). here we generate linear scale-space using gaussian kernels and a nonlinear domain by anisotropic diffusion filtering. the nonlinear space smooths the interior of local pixel neighborhoods and preserves edge localization. we generate five scales in each domain resulting in 10 additional features. in our feature domain, we included the spatial coordinates of each sample on the image plane. to reduce variability resulting from the pose or size of each subject, we decided to map the spatial coordinates to a canonical space. we applied principal axes registration (23,24) to the abdominal mask-produced in the segmentation stage-to estimate a linear transformation model with 6° of freedom corresponding to translation, rotation, and scaling. we first compute the translation using the trunk's centroid. the principal component analysis (pca) eigenvector orientations determine the rotation parameters and the eigenvalues determine the scaling factors. we then mapped the spatial coordinates of our samples to the canonical space using the computed transforms. we also added the original ct intensities, median filtered and gradient magnitude of original ct image features to our texture, scale-space and spatial coordinates features, forming a feature space of dimensionality d = 63. an example of an original ct image and the computed texture features is depicted in figure 5. our goal was to train the classifier to distinguish the food residues from visceral fat based on the computed features and to integrate these results in the last step of our fat quantification methodology to reduce the false positives produced by the fat segmentation stage. in the classification step, we used a two-class support vector machine classifier (25) with a radial kernel function. svm is a statistical machine learning technique that can be used for regression or classification. it can be applied to linear or nonlinear problems by means of a kernel function that maps the data samples to a high-dimensional feature space in which the problem becomes linearly separable (25). in the binary classification problem, we typically have a training data set comprising n data samples x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n , with targets t 1 , t 2 , ..., t n such that t n ∈ {−1, 1}. our objective is to define a decision function y(x), which in the linear form is y(x) = w t φ(x) + b, and to be able to classify new data points x according to the sign of y(x). this is considered to be a constrained optimization problem and can be solved by use of lagrangian multipliers a n . the function to be optimized becomes: (2) where a = {a 1 , ... a n }. for nonlinear decision functions, the solution is to define a kernel function advantages of this technique are good generalization capability, robustness in high dimensions, and convexity of the objective function. because of these advantages, the literature of svm theory and applications is very broad. more detailed and formal descriptions of svms can be found elsewhere (25)(26)(27). as mentioned previously, because visceral fat is more prevalent than food residues at an approximate rate of 11.4:1, our dataset is imbalanced. although svm is known to be able to handle moderately imbalanced data, we tested two different approaches for classification. the first one was to use cost-weighting to each class and the other was based on resampling. in cost-weighing, we followed the method reported by chang et al (28) that produced encouraging results previous work (29). we also implemented bootstrap aggregation (25) (ie, bagging) in the training stage as an alternate strategy for addressing imbalanced classes. for each subject, we randomly undersampled the majority class (ie, visceral fat) to match the sample size of the minority class (ie, food residues), and trained our classifier over the undersampled train dataset. we repeated this process n times (n = 5) thus producing n different models. at the testing stage, we predicted the class of each pixel by each model and applied classifier decision voting to produce the final classification. to illustrate the significance of the food residue removal process, we computed the percentages of food residues over the visceral fat area and the visceral fat areas from reference measurements. a clinical specialist produced reference masks of subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, and food residues using a semimanual workflow. this step produced n = 516,340 pixel samples extracted from 168 ct images. we then plotted the food residue percentages versus the visceral fat areas as depicted in figure 6. from this figure, we conclude that there is no significant correlation between food residue areas and visceral fat areas; therefore, we cannot predict the food residue areas from visceral fat measurements. we also note that although the average percentage of food residues is relatively small (ie, about 3.6%), it has a considerable variance (minimum = 0% and maximum = 81%) that may bias visceral fat quantification. as a result, this source of error needs to be addressed. in our next experiment, we trained and tested the classification scheme using different feature selection/extraction techniques. our classification targets were the reference masks of visceral fat and food residues produced by the semimanual workflow. we compared the classification performance of the complete feature domain described in the previous section with the use of linear or nonlinear scale-space, gabor-based, or laws-based features only. we also tested a feature selection methodology that selects the top ranking features according to the fisher's distance measure, the hierarchical dimensionality reduction (hdr) feature extraction method that iteratively computes the correlation matrix between features and merges the most correlated feature pair until the lower correlation threshold is reached (25), and pca-based dimensionality reduction. to evaluate these techniques, we report the classification rates using six-fold cross-validation (table 1). more specifically, we report values of true-positive rate (tpr), true-positive rate (tnr), classification accuracy (acc), and area under the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve (auc). the original feature space produces the most accurate classification indicating that all employed features contribute the separation between visceral fat and food residues. we then used k-fold cross-validation with k ∈ {2, 4, 6} in the complete feature space (d = 63) and computed the classification rates. in table 2, we observe that the classifier achieves very encouraging rates of accuracy. although the sensitivity is very high, the lower specificity rates can be expected from the very diverse texture profiles of food residues and their considerable intensity overlapping with the visceral fat. we also note that as we use fewer samples for training-for example, 50% of the data for training and 50% for testing in twofold cross-validation-the loss in specificity (tnr) becomes more apparent. still, the classification rates remain high, indicating solid generalizability. we make similar observations about generalization performance in figure 7 that displays roc curves for kfold cross-validation and table 2 that reports auc measurements for the roc experiments. the auc is slightly reduced for smaller values of k. furthermore, we tested the two different approaches for classification of imbalanced data, namely the cost-weighting and classifier-bagging technique. the results in table 2 were produced by cost-weighting in the training stage, whereas the results of resampling and bagging approach are displayed in table 3. the cost-weighting approach produces a bit higher classification accuracy, whereas bagging has higher specificity. the auc measurements are approximately equal. another experiment was to assess the segmentation accuracy of the subcutaneous fat, the visceral cavity-that includes all tissues besides the subcutaneous region and the visceral fat after food residue removal. we compared the segmentations produced by our approach to semimanual delineations produced by a human operator over our dataset of 168 images. we first estimated the error between areas computed by the tested and reference workflows. the measures of agreement were the area error relative to the manual segmentation and the pearson correlation coefficient between the two groups of measurements. because the area errors do not account for the overlap between the segmented regions, we also computed the dice similarity coefficient (30) to assess the segmentation accuracy. the results in table 4 show that the automated segmentation algorithm achieves a high level of accuracy. we have introduced a method for assessment of regional abdominal fat from ct images aiming for application to large scale datasets of epidemiological studies. the focal point of this article is the food residue identification and removal scheme that was developed to address the occurrence of visceral fat false positives when using conventional thresholding/ clustering methods of the literature. having formulated this task as a pattern classification problem, we computed and extracted intensity-and texture-based features, and subsequently evaluated the classification accuracy with respect to different feature domains. our experiments indicated that the combined use of intensity, textural, and spatial domain information produces better separation between the food residues and visceral fat. we note that the sole use of intensity-based information cannot separate the two classes efficientlyas expected by the large overlap in hu space. the introduction of spatial coordinates in canonical space produced by principal axes registration clearly improves the classification performance, but still the classification error is more than 10%.we added texture representation features produced by gabor and law's kernels and achieved a considerable increase in sensitivity. the gabor features and law's features provide equivalent separability but their joint use improves the classification performance. the inclusion of scale-space features further improves the specificity of classification. the gabor features offer a multiscale and multiorientation texture representation, whereas the law's features measure the local texture energy. the scale-space analysis was included to describe the morphological intensity changes in multiple scales. the morphology of food residues is expected to be dependent on the specific scale of analysis, whereas the visceral fat pixels are expected to have more uniform intensity distribution in their neighborhood on the image plane. in the hdr-based feature selection process, several law's and some scale-space features were found more correlated and merged first. the hdr method is characterized by increased specificity and slightly decreased sensitivity. the pca dimensionality reduction also improved specificity and decreased sensitivity relatively to the complete feature space. the fisher-based feature selection method shows increased separation for the law's and gabor features and the anteroposterior spatial coordinates. the overall classification produced by fisher-based feature selection is less accurate than the complete feature space, hdr, and pca methods because it lacks sensitivity. overall, these results indicate that the complete feature space is the most suitable solution because our clinically relevant variable is the visceral fat that corresponds to the majority class. in the second set of experiments, we evaluated the generalization performance of food identification and observed a limited loss of specificity because we used fewer samples for training. this indicates that the food detection generalizes in a predicted manner and can be used for the complete database of the blsa. these results were supported by a clinical scientist who visually inspected individual segmentation and quantification results over an extensive set of 1849 blsa ct images and observed very limited visceral fat misclassifications. another interesting consideration is the selection of an appropriate model to handle imbalanced data. we tested cost-weighting and classifier-bagging approaches and report the results in tables 2 and 3. in these results, we observe that the cost-weighting method performs better in terms of sensitivity and classification accuracy, whereas bagging significantly improves specificity and produces similar but more stable auc values. the decision on which approach to use is mainly driven by the application. when we are interested in sensitivity, the cost-weighting method may be more appropriate. on the other hand, when specificity is more important, then classifier-bagging is more suitable. in addition, we conducted segmentation validation experiments to assess the separation of subcutaneous fat region from the visceral cavity. the results in table 4 show a high level of agreement between the automated and semimanual segmentation methods. the subcutaneous fat and visceral cavity segmentations produce lower relative errors and higher dice scores than the visceral fat segmentation. this is expected because visceral fat segmentation is susceptible to errors mainly caused by the partial volume effect and food residue false positives. still, the segmentation accuracy is quite encouraging and applicable to clinical studies. the main advantage of our technique is that it significantly reduces a type of error that was not addressed in previous published work to the best of our knowledge. this approach also is automated and therefore time-efficient and reproducible in nature. in addition, we note that the automated separation of visceral fat from subcutaneous fat is largely insensitive to anatomical differences and that the main parameter modifications are related to the thickness of subcutaneous region. on the other hand, this method was developed using cross-sectional study frame of thinking. therefore an extension of this technique would be to use prior segmentations of each participant as baselines for subsequent time points in longitudinal analyses. another limitation is related to the data that are two-dimensional; therefore, the estimated regional fat may be subject to variability of anatomical site selection during acquisition. in conclusion, we presented an automated abdominal fat quantification scheme with removal of false positives that is applied to ct imaging data. the method can be divided into the stages of global fat identification, segmentation of subcutaneous fat, and removal of food residues. the key contribution of this work is the development of a statistical learning scheme aiming for detection and removal of food residues from the visceral fat region. our method was found to meet the accuracy requirements when validated against a reference standard over a set of 168 ct images selected from the blsa. the reduction of food residues improves the quantification accuracy of visceral fat that is expected to be critical in resolving scientific questions related to clinical outcomes. flow diagram of our abdomen fat quantification algorithm (top). it can be divided into three main processes: identification of global fat voxels, separation of visceral from

       " \"viruses have been replicating in vertebrates for more than 450 million years (aiewsakun and katzourakis, 2017) . this host-pathogen interaction has exerted a selective pressure over time and affected specific allelic frequencies of certain populations to favor a particular genetic variant. the frequent outbreaks of coronaviruses in china (sars-cov-1 in 2003, and the current sars-cov-2) raised the possibility that asians have unique genetic factors that influence their susceptibility to coronaviruses . in addition, the large variation in coronavirus disease 2019 clinical manifestation has raised multiple questions on the underlying factors, including host genetics. moreover, covid-19 mortality rates were considerably variable between different regions, ranging from 0.06% (singapore) to 15% (the united kingdom) (statistica, 2020). interestingly, although qatar has the world's highest covid-19 infection rate per million people (38,714 cases/million), it is one of the countries reporting the lowest severity (1% icu cases) and mortality rates (0.16%) (our world in data, 2020). although age, health condition, disease management, and health systems contribute to different disease outcomes, there is a strong indication that vulnerability to covid-19 is influenced by host genetic architecture (tanigawa and rivas, 2020) . in an effort to explore the susceptibility to sars-cov-1 in chinese populations, multiple gwass were conducted. despite the limitation in the number of sars-cov-1 infected individuals, few reports identified significant associations. for instance, a variant (rs2248690) in the α-2-heremans-schmid glycoprotein (ahsg) gene, which is required for macrophage deactivation, was found to affect ahsg level in the blood (zhu et al., 2011) . carriers of the t allele had lower ahsg serum concentration and increased risk of sars illness (zhu et al., 2011) . low levels of the mannose-binding lectin (mbl), another key molecule in innate immunity, caused by a missense variant (rs1800450), was also linked to increased sars-cov-1 susceptibility (tu et al., 2015) . similarly, a functional polymorphism of the chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 2 (ccl2) gene (rs1024611) was associated with an increased risk of sars-cov-1 infection (tu et al., 2015) . ccl2 belongs to the chemokines family, and plays a vital role in immune cells trafficking during sars-cov-1 infection (law et al., 2005) . in addition, a variant (rs2280788) within another chemokine encoding gene, ccl5, has been found to associate with sars susceptibility, hospitalization, and risk of death (ng et al., 2007) . other variants in cytokines encoding genes have also been linked to sars outcomes. specifically, a polymorphism in the interferon (ifn)-γ gene (rs2430561, a), which is essential in driving t helper cell type 1 (th1), monocytes, and macrophages responses, showed a dose-dependent increase in the susceptibility to sars-cov-1 (chong et al., 2006) . il4, on the other hand, promotes and stimulates both t-cell and b-cell differentiation, and balances th1 and th2 responses, therefore, directly affects infection outcomes (choi and reiser, 1998) . a meta-analysis by patarčić et al. (2015) reported on the association of interleukin 4 (il4) polymorphism (rs2070874) and multiple respiratory infections, including sars-cov-1. another key t-cell activation molecule is the intercellular adhesion molecule-3 (icam3). sars-cov-1 patients carrying a genetic polymorphism in the icam3 gene (rs2304237) showed higher lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) level, lower wbc count, and thus, poorer prognosis (chan et al., 2007) . similarly, a snp (rs4804803) located in the cd209, or the dendritic cell-specific icam-3-grabbing nonintegrin (dc-sign) gene promoter, was associated with high ldh levels in sars-cov-1 patients (chan et al., 2010) . this gene encodes for an important c-type lectin that acts as a pathogen receptor. previous studies demonstrated that cd209 interacts with the spike (s)-protein of sars-cov-1 and enhances spike (s)-pseudotyped sars-cov-1 infection in susceptible cells (marzi et al., 2004) . it was found that sars-cov-1 patients who carry -336a > g variant have a 60% chance of having a poorer prognosis (chan et al., 2010) . recent studies indicated that sars-cov-2 spread depends on the transmembrane serine protease 2 (tmprss2) for virus entry (hoffmann et al., 2020b) . importantly, sars-cov-2 is characterized by the acquisition of a s1/s2 multibasic cleavage site, and therefore, other proteases, including furin and cathepsin b/l could substitute tmprss2 (hoffmann et al., 2020a,b) . considering that influenza virus entry also utilizes tmprss2 for the cleavage of viral hemagglutinin (ha) protein, the genetic association of tmprss2 variants and influenza infection was previously investigated. variants within tmprss2 (rs2070788, rs383510) were found to increase tmprss2 expression and significantly correlate with influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 and a(h7n9) susceptibility and severity (cheng et al., 2015) . on the other hand, there was no gwas on the association between cathepsin b/l (ctsb/ctsl) variants and viral infections, and only one gwas identified a variant (rs4932178, t) in furin promoter that was linked to furin upregulation in hepatitis b patients (lei et al., 2009) . given the similarity between the novel sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1, as well as the involvement of different proteases in the sars-cov-2 pathogenesis, this study investigates and compares the frequency of the above-mentioned variants among the qatari as well as other populations. the present study included a subpopulation (n = 6,218) from a cohort of 10,694 participants in qatar biobank. a detailed demographic characterization of this cohort has been previously documented (al thani et al., 2019) . briefly, qatar biobank enrolls adults (age ≥ 18 years), following certain inclusion/exclusion criteria to obtain a representative sample of the permanent heterogeneous population that resides in qatar. all subjects are qatari nationals or long-term residents (≥15 years living in qatar). qatari individuals represent 85% of the total number of qbb participants, while long-term residents (ltr)-arabs and ltr-non-arabs represent 12% and 3%, respectively. the mean age of enrolled subjects was 40.5 years (sd ± 12). whole-genome sequences of 6,218 qatari nationals or longterm residents who had previously participated in qatar genome programme (qgp) were obtained. sequencing read data were previously generated by illumina hiseq x ten1 sequencers and converted from the native bcl format to paired-end fastq2 format using bcl2fastq3. the quality of the raw data was assessed using fastqc4. data passing quality control was then aligned to the reference genome sequence [build grch37 (hs37d5)5] using the bwa-kit6 aligner [v7.12]. variant calling was performed using gatk7 haplotype caller [v3.3], and annotation of the resulting vcf8 was performed using snpeff9 [v4.1b] and the following databases: dbsnp10 v138 and dbnsfp11 v2.9. the genetic variant data was then converted to plink file format using plink-1.9 (purcell et al., 2007) . standardized quality-assurance and quality control (qa/qc) methods were followed to generate high quality and confidence on both snps and sample levels, as previously described (albagha et al., 2011) . briefly, variants with genotype call rate < 90%, hardy-weinberg p-value < 1 × 10 −6 were removed. samples with excess heterozygosity (n = 8), duplicates (n = 10), call rate < 95% (n = 1), gender ambiguity (n = 65), and population outlier (n = 87) were removed. the final file used for calculating allele frequency contained 6,047 subjects. data on snps previously linked to sars-cov-1 susceptibility were collected from previous gwas (chong et al., 2006; chan et al., 2007 chan et al., , 2010 ng et al., 2007; lei et al., 2009; zhu et al., 2011; cheng et al., 2015; patarčić et al., 2015; tu et al., 2015) . snps associated with susceptibility to other viral infections located in genes significant for sars disease were also included in the analysis. only snps that were reported to have significant associations with viral infections (p-value < 0.05) were included. for the same set of genes, quantitative trait loci (eqtls) were retrieved from eqtls datasets 1,2 . only snps showing robust association with gene expression (association p-value < 1 × 10 −8 ) were extracted. subsequently, the effect of snps on gene expression in whole blood was obtained from the genotype-tissue expression (gtex) database 3 . plink v1.9 was used to prune eqtl snps into a list of independent variants (purcell et al., 2007) . snps within a window of 25 kb and with linkage disequilibrium r 2 > 0.5 were pruned into a single independent snp using the plink commandindep-pairwise 25 5 0.5. allele frequencies (af) between different populations were compared using the pearson chi2 test, with a p-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant. a total of 74 snps were identified from the literature. these snps are located in 10 genes: icam3, ifn-γ, ccl2, ccl5, ahsg, mbl, furin, tmprss2, il4, and cd209 promoter. table 1 summarizes the list of all sars-cov-1 related snps reported by previous gwas (n = 11) and their potential effect during infection. we first compared the frequencies of sars-cov-1 related snps in qatari population genomes (n = 6047) to the global afs from the 1000genome dataset (the international genome sample resource [igsr], 2015) . in addition, we calculated the fold difference in the af in comparison to the eastern asian (eas) population specifically (n = 504), since all these susceptibility snps were originally identified in the chinese population (figure 1) . analysis of qatari genomes revealed that the qatari population has significantly lower frequency of the risk alleles in each of: ccl2, mbl, ccl5, ahsg, and il4 (0.336, 0.099, 0.004, 0.09, and 0.137, respectively), compared to the 1000genome (0.367, 0.122, 0.025, 0.24, and 0.401, respectively), as well to the eas population (0.547, 0.148, 0.095, 0.161, and 0.779, respectively). remarkably, the most significant difference was observed in rs2280788 that is located in the ccl5 gene. the frequency of the risk allele (c) among qatari population was 6.6fold lower than the 1000genomes (0.372 vs. 2.4%), and 25.6-fold lower than that of the eas population (9.52%). second in line was rs2070874 in il4 gene, where the frequency of the risk variant (t) among qataris showed around 3-fold decrease (13.7%) compared to the global af (40.1%), and a 5.7-fold decrease compared to eas population (77.9%). additionally, the ahsg risk variant (rs2248690, risk allele = t), was less frequently detected among qataris (af = 0.09), with a 2.7-fold decrease compared to the eas population (af = 0.16). however, although snps in ccl2 and mbl genes were significantly different among the qatari population, the fold difference was marginal (1 to 2-fold change). on the other hand, a higher frequency of the risk alleles located within ifn-γ, icam3, furin, and tmprss2 was observed in the qatari population (0.517, 0.314, 0.376, and 0.433, respectively), in comparison to 1000genomes (0.28, 0.18, 0.264, and 0.396, respectively), and to the eas population (0.159, 0.113, 0.16, and 0.36, respectively). notably, qatari genomes showed 3.3-and 2.8fold increase in the af of ifn-γ and icam3 snps compared to the eas population. the af of cd209 variant among qataris was comparable to that of 1000genomes; however, it showed a 3.5-fold decrease in comparison to the eas population. we further explored the inter-population variations for each snp to identify significant differences (figure 2) . the ccl5 risk allele (c, rs2280788) was considerably more common among people from eas (0.952), reaching to a 32-fold increase compared to the african and qatari populations that exhibited the lowest frequency of this risk allele (0.003 of each population). similarly, the percentage of individuals harboring the risk allele (t) in il4 (rs2070874) was the highest among eas population (77.9%) and the lowest among european population (16.8%). likewise, the risk allele (a) of snp rs4804803 in cd209 promoter, as well as ccl2 risk variant (g, rs1024611) were significantly higher among eass compared to all other populations (93.15%, frontiers in genetics | www.frontiersin.org figure 1 | fold differences in the risk allelic frequencies of sars-cov-1-related snps among

(55.52% and 22.77%, respectively). africans showed an extremely lower af of mbl risk variant (t, rs1800450, af = 0.013), which is 9-folds less than the global af (0.122), while americans presented the highest af (0.219). likewise, the frequency of the risk allele (g) of tmprss2 rs2070788 was the lowest among africans (0.2738), and the highest in americans (0.4942). however, the other snp that also affects tmprss2 expression (rs383510) was more frequent among european population (0.4851), while african population also exhibited the lowest frequency (0.3268). the distribution of the t risk allele of ahsg gene was similarly high among africans and americans (0.2784 and 0.3646, respectively), but less detected among qatari population (9%). qatari individuals, on the other hand, showed the highest af in risk variants of furin (t, rs4932178, 0.3763), icam3 (c, rs2304237, 0.3141), and ifn-γ (a, rs2430561, 0.5167) in comparison to all other populations. lastly, for the same set of genes, we investigated the genetic variations that were already annotated as eqtls in the whole blood, which might affect disease susceptibility or severity. we also used qgp dataset and as well as data deposited in 1000genome for the analysis. only four out of ten genes had significant associations in the eqtl databases: ccl5, cd209, icam3, and mbl, where 63 eqtls were located (supplementary table s1 ). of these, only ten variants were found to be independent snps and were further investigated. table 2 demonstrates the eqtls included in the analysis and their suggested effect on gene expression. our analysis showed that the frequency of almost all these eqtl variants differs considerably between populations. mainly, african ancestry has up to 4-fold decrease in the frequency of eqtls in cd209 (rs10518270), and icam3 (rs3181049 and rs3176767). the european population, on the other hand, had the lowest frequency of rs4239252 in ccl5 (2.4-fold difference). of note, other eqtls appear to vary between populations, yet, with a lower fold difference ( table 3) . since the start of the current sars-cov-2 pandemic, scientists have been puzzling over the factors underlying the interindividual and inter-population differences in disease outcomes. the resulting clinical manifestation of covid-19 varied enormously, ranging from mild/asymptomatic illness in 80% of patients to a severe respiratory syndrome in 20%, which further progresses to critical illness requiring ventilation in 5% (cdc, 2020) . in addition, the mortality rates were interestingly different between countries. as of august 5, 2020, the highest mortality rate was seen in european countries such as in the united kingdom, italy, and france, reaching 15% (statistica, 2020). on the contrary, the lowest rate of death from covid-19 was reported from several western and south asian countries such as singapore (0.06%), qatar (0.1%), and bahrain (0.27%) and african countries such as rwanda (0.24%) and uganda (0.42%) (statistica, 2020). these figures are affected by several factors, including the testing capacity in each country, the age and health status of individuals, the efficiency of the health system, and the possible circulation of different viral strains. however, population genetics can also be a key factor. the earlier sars-cov-1 outbreak in 2003 had shed some light on the host genetic contribution in disease manifestations and outcomes. a number of gwass have identified genetic markers with associations with sars-cov-1, yet, all were conducted on chinese population, where sars-cov-1 originated and mainly circulated. nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the prevalence and frequency of these variants have never analyzed in comparison to other populations, including the middle east and north africa (mena) population. accordingly, in this report, we performed a comparative analysis on a set of genetic polymorphisms that could have a potential effect on sars-cov-2 susceptibility or severity, utilizing the datasets from qatar genome programme (qgp), as well as the 1000genomes. initially, we looked at the overall burden of risk variants associated with sars-cov-1 in the qatari population. these variants are mostly located in genes involved in viral entry (tmprss2 and furin), cytokine production (ifn-γ and il4), and immune responses (icam3, ccl2, ccl5, ahsg, mbl, and cd209). our analysis showed a remarkable decrease in the risk allelic frequencies of snps linked to sars severity in the qatari population, such as il4, ahsg, ccl5, and ccl2 variants. however, the qatari population had a significantly higher frequency of snps related to increased disease susceptibility, including tmprss2, furin, and ifn-γ variants. the only genetic polymorphism associated with sars-cov-1 severity and found at a higher rate among qataris is the icam3 gene polymorphism (rs2304237). this variant was previously reported to upregulate icam3 gene expression and increase sars-cov-1 severity. nonetheless, two eqtls in the same gene (rs3181049 and rs3176767), which are responsible for downregulating icam3 expression and potentially decreasing sars-cov-1 severity, were detected at the highest rate among qataris. these findings align with the current situation in qatar, where high rates of sars-cov-2 infections are reported despite the low severity (icu cases = 1%), and mortality rates (0.1%) (ministry of public health [moph], 2020). although this data mostly represent the disease spread among expatriates who represent 85% of qatar population, qatari citizens also have extremely low fatality rates (0.07%, personal communication, june 2020). investigating the differences in the distribution of sars-cov-1 associated snps and eqtls in different populations showed great diversity. the fold difference in afs between populations reached up to 32-fold change as observed in rs2280788 (ccl5 gene) which was found in 9.5% of eas population compared to 0.3% only among africans and qataris. similarly, rs1800450 in the mbl gene showed a high variability between populations (16fold difference). this variant was found in 22% of americans compared to only 1.36% of africans. this data highlights again the importance of explaining infections spread and pathogenesis in the light of population genetics. noticeably, the european population showed an opposite fold direction in the allelic frequency of most snps compared to the african and eas propulsions. in other words, all risk variants, which were more commonly detected in europeans (tmprss2, furin, icam3, and ifn-γ), were significantly lower among africans and eass. in fact, compared to all other populations, african descent seems to carry substantially lower frequencies of the risk alleles in most snps (8 out of 11 snps). previous population genetics studies pointed out the great differences in the amplitude of the immune response between africans and europeans, especially in genes related to inflammatory and antiviral responses (quach et al., 2016) . in agreement with our findings, a recent study also showed that african have a genetic predisposition for lower expression levels of both ace2 and tmprss2 genes, which are key viral entry genes in sars-cov-2 infection (ortiz-fernández and sawalha, 2020). collectively, this could explain the population differences in covid-19 infection and fatality rates. africa is still considered an outlier in terms of covid-19 spread. the number of cases in africa (as of august 5, 2020) is the lowest (981,593 positive cases), compared to other continents (3-5 million positive cases) (worldometers, 2020) . additionally, despite their fragile health system, africans are still reporting a relatively low mortality rate (2.2%), compared to the global death rate, which is 3.7% (worldometers, 2020) . nonetheless, it is worth mentioning that the limited testing capacity in african countries could largely underestimate the actual burden. to the contrary, it has been reported that the death rate from covid-19 is 6-fold higher among african americans counties compared to predominantly white counties (yancy, 2020) . whether this observation is solely related to socioeconomic and cultural factors or also affected by genetic factors, require further investigation. although sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 were originally identified in eas (china), our analysis revealed that only three susceptibility loci were significantly higher among the eass (il4, cd209 promoter, and ccl2). this could be attributed to the limited set of variants included in our analysis and does not exclude the possibility of the eas population being differently vulnerable to coronaviruses. a recent study reported that eas individuals have higher allele frequencies in the eqtl variants associated with augmented ace2 expression in tissues, suggesting a possible different susceptibility or response to sars-cov-2 (cao et al., 2020) . nonetheless, additional well-designed studies, larger in size and scope, are needed to better characterize the population differences in sars-cov2 susceptibility and disease outcomes. one of the main clinical features of severe covid-19 is the exacerbated inflammatory response. both sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 infections are known to induce a massive overrelease of cytokines, which contributes to infection pathogenesis and severity. sars-cov-infected cells produce high levels of chemokines, including ccl2, and ccl5, and proinflammatory cytokines such as ifn-γ (chang et al., 2020) . we found that variants, which increase the expression of these molecules specifically, are distributed differently among populations, and consequently, will differ between individuals. these variants could be useful as prognostic markers to stratify patients and identify high-risk individuals. in conclusion, we highlight here the population-dependent variations in genes potentially influencing sars-cov-2 infection. results from this work emphasize the importance of understanding the interplay between host genetic factors and response to infections, which could have important implications on public health infections control and therapeutics. importantly, results presented here provide preliminary insights that necessitate functional validation in future studies. all datasets presented in this study are included in the article/supplementary material.\"]"
